# Introduction
This site aims to provide examples and API documentation for working with
[WebGPU](https://webgpu.dev) using the
[Dawn Native](https://dawn.googlesource.com) WebGPU API. Dawn provides both
a C and C++ interface when using Dawn Native.

The source for the examples can all be found in the
[Dusk Github](https://github.com/dj2/Dusk) repo. Any issues, suggestions or
comments can added as [issues](https://github.com/dj2/Dusk/issues/new) or
[discussions](https://github.com/dj2/Dusk/discussions/new) as appropriate.

In order to build the examples, please see the
[README.md](https://github.com/dj2/Dusk#requirements) which provides the
instructions to get up and running.
