# Dusk

The Dusk repository contains a series of examples which show usage of
the Dawn native API. Each example is designed to be standalone so each
example contains copies of all the required code for that example. This should
make it easier to determine exactly what code is needed at any given point.

Note, the README.md files in each folder only talk about the new ideas and
concepts provided in that example. So, looking at README.md files in earlier
examples maybe needed to understand the concepts that were introduced earlier.

This is not an officially supported Google product.

## Requirements
 * `depot_tools`
 * `cmake`
 * `ninja`
 * `clang` or `gcc`


## Building
```
gclient sync --jobs=16
mkdir -p out/Debug
cd out/Debug
CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -GNinja ../..
ninja
```

## Setup
Dawn has a lot of dependencies, in order to simplify things this repo is using
the `gclient` command from
[depot_tools](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up)
to handle the heavy lifting of checkout out all the needed dependencies.

In order to make `gclient` happy we require a `git` repo for our project and it
needs to have an commit. Simply doing the following will get things setup for
`.gclient`.

```
mkdir <project> && cd <project>
git init
touch README.md
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

Two files are needed for `gclient`. First copy in [.gclient](./.gclient) which is
the basic `gclient` setup file. Then, copy in [DEPS](./DEPS) which is the
dependency configuration file.

For our purposes a specific revision of Dawn is chosen (the tip-of-tree commit
at random point in time). This is done such that every checkout will get the
same version of Dawn and we can upgrade Dawn in a controlled fashion.

The `recursedeps` section tells `gclient` to go into the `third_party/dawn`
folder and run the `DEPS` file found there. This will checkout all of the Dawn
dependencies at the correct commit for Dawn (and recursively as needed).

The examples are using `CMake` for build configuration. The CMake is pretty
standard, c++20 is used for a few of the newer features. The only things of note
are, adding the `third_party/dawn/include` directory to the `target_include_directories`
and when linking the executable we add the following to the `target_link_libraries`:

* `webgpu_dawn`
* `webgpu_cpp`
* `webgpu_glfw`
* `glfw`

The last two are only needed because `GLFW` is being used for the window management.
If something else is providing the window, and code is written to create the
needed surface, the last two libraries can be removed.

## Examples

The following examples are provided:

* [01 - Adapter and Device Information](src/example_01/README.md)
* [02 - Coloured Triangle](src/example_02/README.md)
* [03 - Using an Index Buffer](src/example_03/README.md)
* [04 - Rotating Cube](src/example_04/README.md)
